**Project Description:**

This project allows users to search for a **_GitHub username_**. If the username is correct, the application displays the user's profile information.
However, if the username is incorrect or doesn't exist, the application gracefully informs the user with a message stating **_'No profile found with this username'_**.
This project aims to provide a seamless experience for exploring GitHub profiles while handling invalid inputs with clear and user-friendly feedback.
